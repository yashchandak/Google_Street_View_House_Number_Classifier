#Information
Cascades trained on Local Binary Pattern (LBP) features for 10 binary classifer, one for each digit {0,1...,9}.

Data was trained by means of Linear Binary Pattern classifier on OpenCV in C++. The classifier ran for 15 levels of training on 2500 instances of each of the ten digits with 3000 negative examples in the data set.

The cascade size is 20x30 pixels.
