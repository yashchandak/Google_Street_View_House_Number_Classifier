Each line contains an image number followed by the number of bounding boxes in the image and 4-tuple of top x co-ordinate, y co-ordinate, width and height

The above format is for both groundtruth as well as CPU generated bounding boxes.

**intersectionOverUnion.txt** contains the ratios of the intersection of CPU and groundtruth boxes to that of their union for each digit.

**confidence_clustersize**: the confidence here is the number of boxes that were clustered together to get the box on the current digit in question. The confidence is an integer.

**confidence_ratio**: this has confidence in terms of a ratio = clustersize of this digit/max clustersize in the image. Confidence is a float value belonging to (0,1]
